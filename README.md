# HGCAL simulation using law


### Resources

- [law](https://law.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
- [luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable)


### Setup

This repository has submodules, so you should clone it with

```shell
git clone -b dev-hgctruth-Jan-windowNTupler --recursive https://github.com/gvonsem/hgcalsim.git
```

If you want to write files into the common hgcalsim output directory on EOS at `/eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hgcal/CMG_studies/hgcalsim` (given that you have the necessary permissions), export

```shell
export HGC_STORE_EOS="/eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hgcal/CMG_studies/hgcalsim"
```

or put the above line in your bashrc.

After cloning, run

```shell
source setup.sh
```

This will install CMSSW and a few python packages **once**. You should source the setup script everytime you start with a new session.


### Luigi scheduler

Task statuses and dependency trees can be visualized live using a central luigi scheduler. **This is optional** and no strict requirement to run tasks.

In order to let the tasks communicate with a central luigi scheduler, you should set

```shell
export HGC_SCHEDULER_HOST="<user>:<pass>@<host>"
```

most probably in your bashrc file. **Otherwise**, you should add `local-scheduler: True` to the `[luigi_core]` section in the `law.cfg` config file or add `--local-scheduler` to all `law run` commands.

You can also [setup a personal scheduler on OpenStack](https://github.com/CMS-HGCAL/hgcalsim/wiki#setting-up-a-luigi-scheduler-on-openstack), or use the [common hgcalsim scheduler](http://hgcalsim-common-scheduler1.cern.ch) (host is `hgcalsim-common-scheduler1`, please [ask](mailto:marcel.rieger@cern.ch?Subject=Access%20to%20common%20hgcalsim%20scheduler) for user and password).


### Storage on EOS

All tasks can write their output targets to EOS. To enable that, add `--eos` to the `law run` commands. By default, the base store path is `/eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hgcal/CMG_studies/$HGC_GRID_USER/hgcalsim` (make sure you have access to the hgcal group space) but can be configured by setting the `HGC_STORE_EOS` environment variable to a path of your choice.


### Example commands

Re-compile CMSSW with 2 cores after making some updates to the code:

```shell
law run sw.CompileCMSSW --n-cores 2
```

Run GSD, RECO, and NTUP steps in one go, shooting 10 events with 2 photons each using the `closebydr` gun for some energy range and overlap setting:

```shell
law run sim.NtupTask \
  --version dev \
  --nevts 10 \
  --gunMode closebydr \
  --partID 22,22 \
  --thresholdMin 1 --thresholdMax 100 \
  --zMin 319 --zMax 319 \
  --rMin 0 --rMax 0.4
```

Run the above steps for 10 tasks on HTCondor (only the last line of the command is differing / added):

```shell
law run sim.NtupTask \
  --version dev \
  --nevts 10 \
  --gunMode closebydr \
  --partID 22,22 \
  --thresholdMin 1 --thresholdMax 100 \
  --zMin 319 --zMax 319 \
  --rMin 0 --rMax 0.4 \
  --n-tasks 10 --pilot --workflow htcondor
```

Testing WindowNtupTask task, for ttbar (no PU):

```shell
law run sim.WindowNtupTask \
  --version dev \
  --nevts 10 \
  --gunMode physproc \
  --gunType ttbar \
  --thresholdMin 10 --thresholdMax 9999 \
  --zMin 0 --zMax 0 \
  --n-tasks 5 --pilot --eos --workflow htcondor --transfer-logs
